## Project Summary


Our website is a place for accessing comprehensive information on significant storms that have occurred across the United States over the past decade. Powered by the Storm Events Database from NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI), our website will offer a user-friendly interface designed to make the wealth of storm data easily accessible to users. 

On our platform, users can effortlessly browse and explore major storms, categorized by year, severity, and impact. Each storm event is detailed, providing information on its location, azimuth, distance, impact, and severity, including the costs of property and crop damages. Our goal is to make it effortless for you to research and showcase significant weather phenomena, from devastating hurricanes to rare meteorological events. Whether you are a weather enthusiast, a researcher, or simply curious about the recent history of storms in the United States, our website offers a valuable resource to dive into the last decade of big storms, all in one place.
